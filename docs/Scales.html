<h1 id="scales">Scales</h1>
<p><em>June 2021</em></p>
<p>To define a scale, we would like to pick a set of notes within an octave so that the intervals between the notes are consonant. One way to accomplish this is based on perfect fifths. We can pick an arbitrary frequency as a starting point (the &quot;tonic&quot;), and then go up in pitch repeatedly by fifths. The first few notes of the scale have the following frequency ratios relative to the tonic:</p>
<ul>
<li>1</li>
<li>3⁄2</li>
<li>9⁄4 = (3⁄2)<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>But, wait, 9⁄4 is greater than 2, so we need to &quot;normalize&quot; this note so it falls within our target range by moving its pitch down an octave to 9⁄8.</p>
