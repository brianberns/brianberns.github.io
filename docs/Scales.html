<h1 id="scales">Scales</h1>
<p><em>June 2021</em></p>
<p>To define a scale, we would like to pick a set of notes within an octave so that the intervals between the notes are consonant.</p>
<h2 id="pythagorean-scale">Pythagorean scale</h2>
<p>We can generate such scales using perfect fifths, after Pythagoras. Pick an arbitrary frequency as a starting point (the &ldquo;tonic&rdquo;), and then go up in pitch repeatedly by fifths. The first few notes in the series have the following frequency ratios relative to the tonic:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: right;"># of fifths</th>
<th>Frequency ratio</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: right;">0</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>0</sup> = 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: right;">1</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>1</sup> = 3⁄2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: right;">2</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>2</sup> = 9⁄4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>But, wait, 9⁄4 is greater than 2, so we need to &ldquo;normalize&rdquo; this note so it falls within our target range by moving its pitch down an octave to 9⁄8.</p>
<p>We can also find notes in the other direction, moving down by fifths instead of up. Again, we need to normalize these notes so that they are between 1 and 2 – moving them up one or more octaves instead of down. The first five notes generated by this process are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th style="text-align: right;"># of fifths</th>
<th>Unnormalized ratio</th>
<th>Normalized ratio</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">-2</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>-2</sup> = 4⁄9</td>
<td>16⁄9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>G</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">-1</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>-1</sup> = 2⁄3</td>
<td>4⁄3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">0</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>0</sup> = 1</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">1</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>1</sup> = 3⁄2</td>
<td>3⁄2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">2</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>2</sup> = 9⁄4</td>
<td>9⁄8</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We've also given the notes names (which seem arbitrary, but will be explained later). Let's put these normalized notes in order from lowest to highest within the octave:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Normalized ratio</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td>1 = 1.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E</td>
<td>9⁄8 = 1.13</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>G</td>
<td>4⁄3 = 1.33</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>3⁄2 = 1.50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>16⁄9 = 1.78</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This series of notes (D, E, G, A, and C) in an octave is called the <a href="https://www.phys.uconn.edu/%7Egibson/Notes/Section3_4/Sec3_4.htm">pentatonic scale</a> (where &ldquo;pentatonic&rdquo; just means a scale containing five notes).</p>
