<h1 id="scales">Scales</h1>
<p><em>June 2021</em></p>
<p>To define a scale, we would like to pick a set of notes within an octave so that the intervals between the notes are consonant.</p>
<h2 id="pythagorean-scale">Pythagorean scale</h2>
<p>We can generate such scales using perfect fifths, after Pythagoras. Pick an arbitrary frequency as a starting point (the &ldquo;tonic&rdquo;), and then go up in pitch repeatedly by fifths. The first few notes in the series have the following frequency ratios relative to the tonic:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: right;"># of fifths</th>
<th>Frequency ratio</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: right;">0</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>0</sup> = 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: right;">1</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>1</sup> = 3⁄2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: right;">2</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>2</sup> = 9⁄4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>But, wait, 9⁄4 is greater than 2, so we need to &ldquo;normalize&rdquo; this note so it falls within our target range by moving its pitch down an octave to 9⁄8.</p>
<p>We can also find notes in the other direction, moving down by fifths instead of up. Again, we need to normalize these notes so that they are between 1 and 2 – moving them up by octaves instead of down. The first seven notes generated by this process are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th style="text-align: right;"># of fifths</th>
<th>Unnormalized ratio</th>
<th>Normalized ratio</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>F</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">-3</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>-3</sup> = 8⁄27</td>
<td>32⁄27</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">-2</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>-2</sup> = 4⁄9</td>
<td>16⁄9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>G</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">-1</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>-1</sup> = 2⁄3</td>
<td>4⁄3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">0</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>0</sup> = 1</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">1</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>1</sup> = 3⁄2</td>
<td>3⁄2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">2</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>2</sup> = 9⁄4</td>
<td>9⁄8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">3</td>
<td>(3⁄2)<sup>3</sup> = 27⁄8</td>
<td>27⁄16</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We've also given the notes arbitrary names. Let's put these normalized notes in order from lowest to highest within the octave:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Ratio to tonic</th>
<th>Ratio to previous note</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td>1 = 1.00</td>
<td>–</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E</td>
<td>9⁄8 = 1.13</td>
<td>9⁄8 : 1 = 9⁄8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>F</td>
<td>32⁄27 = 1.19</td>
<td>32⁄27 : 9⁄8 = 256⁄243</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>G</td>
<td>4⁄3 = 1.33</td>
<td>4⁄3 : 32⁄27 = 9⁄8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>3⁄2 = 1.50</td>
<td>3⁄2 : 4⁄3 = 9⁄8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
<td>27⁄16 = 1.69</td>
<td>27⁄16 : 3⁄2 = 9⁄8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>16⁄9 = 1.78</td>
<td>16⁄9 : 27⁄16 = 256⁄243</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td>2⁄1 = 2.00</td>
<td>2⁄1 : 16⁄9 = 9⁄8</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So the notes in this scale are D, E, F, G, A, B, and C. The scale then lands back on D, one octave higher.</p>
<h2 id="diatonic-scales">Diatonic scales</h2>
<p>We've also computed the ratio of each note relative to the previous note in the scale. Luckily<a id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>, there are only two distinct step sizes in the scale:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Step size</th>
<th>Name</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>9⁄8 = 1.13</td>
<td>Whole step</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>256⁄243 = 1.05</td>
<td>Half step</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As a result, the notes in the scale are distributed somewhat evenly throughout the octave, which seems desirable. The pattern of whole (<code>W</code>) and half (<code>h</code>) steps is <code>W h W W W h W</code>, but since the scale repeats at every octave, so does the pattern: <code>W h W W W h W W h W W W h W W h W W W h W</code> ... . Any scale that follows a similar pattern of half steps separated by two or three whole steps is called a <a href="https://www.phys.uconn.edu/%7Egibson/Notes/Section3_4/Sec3_4.htm">diatonic scale</a>, such as the white keys on a piano.</p>

<p>Is it luck? There doesn't seem to be anything in the process that guarantees such an outcome mathematically, but I could be wrong. It just seems to work out nicely.<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-back-ref">&#8617;</a></p>
