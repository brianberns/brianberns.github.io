<h1 id="music-theory-and-sine-waves">Music theory and sine waves</h1>
<p><em>June 2021</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I have a decent understanding of physics and a love of music, but music theory has always mystified me. In this series, I'd like to document my notes on the topic as I try to learn it from scratch. I'm sure this will be far from comprehensive or rigorous, so I welcome suggestions and corrections.</p>
<h2 id="sine-waves">Sine waves</h2>
<p>Why are sine waves used to describe basic musical sounds? This might seem obvious, but it isn't, and the question is often glossed over. The sound of a plucked string, for example, is <strong>not</strong> a pure sine wave. Pure sine waves actually sound <a href="https://szynalski.com/tone#A4,v0.06">unpleasant</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, we can use a Fourier transform to represent any sound as the sum of sine waves, but that begs the question. Why not use some other waveform as the basis for music theory? I think there are two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sine waves describe simple harmonic motion, in which a restoring force is proportional to displacement (<a href="https://www.compadre.org/osp/EJSS/4464/250.htm">Hooke's law</a>). This is the simplest of all vibrating systems, and can be used to model the vibrations of musical instruments.<a id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Adding two sine waves of the same frequency, but with any phase and magnitude, produces <a href="https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SumOfSines/">another sine wave of the same frequency</a>. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">unique property</a> is what makes sine waves a good basis for Fourier analysis.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The use of &quot;simplest&quot; here actually continues to beg the question, though. Why isn't a square wave considered simpler? Maybe someone else can provide a better explanation.<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-back-ref">&#8617;</a></p>
