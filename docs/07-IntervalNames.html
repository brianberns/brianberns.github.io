<p><em>July 2021</em></p>
<p>We are finally in a position to explain the names of intervals that we've been using. (This gets complicated quickly, so the explanation will be somewhat simplified.)</p>
<h2 id="number">Number</h2>
<p>An interval's numerical value comes from the number of diatonic notes spanned by the interval. For example, the interval from C to G is a &ldquo;fifth&rdquo; because the diatonic sequence from C to G always contains five notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A♭ major: C-D♭-E♭-F-G</li>
<li>C major: C-D-E-F-G</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on for other diatonic scales containing C and G.</p>
<p>We can stack intervals but have to be careful about the way addition works. For example, C-E is a third, and E-G is a third, but C-G is a fifth (rather than a sixth).</p>
<h2 id="major-minor-and-perfect-intervals">Major, minor, and perfect intervals</h2>
<p>The most consonant intervals within an octave are said to be &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; intervals: unison, fourth, fifth, and octave. Consider the difference between a major and minor scale that both begin on the same note (i.e. &ldquo;parallel&rdquo; scales). For example, C major/minor:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>#</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">C major</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">C minor</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">C</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">C</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">D</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">D</td>

<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">E</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">E♭</td>

<tr>

<td style="text-align: center;">F</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">F</td>

<td>5</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">G</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">G</td>

<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">A</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">A♭</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">B</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">B♭</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Relative to the tonic, the fourth (C-F) and fifth (C-G) intervals are the same in both scales (as are the unison and octave, of course). The other intervals have major and minor versions.</p>

<p>The minor version of an interval is always a half step smaller than the major version.</p>
<p>Intervals within an octave are called &ldquo;simple&rdquo;, and intervals that extend beyond an octave are called &ldquo;compound&rdquo;. For example, a ninth is an octave plus a second, and a (perfect) eleventh is an octave plus a fourth.</p>
<h2 id="augmented-and-diminished-intervals">Augmented and diminished intervals</h2>
<p>Any interval can be augmented by a half step, or diminished by a half step. An augmented perfect or major interval is called an augmented interval (e.g. an augmented fourth is a half step larger than a perfect fourth). A diminished perfect or minor interval is called a diminished interval (e.g. a diminished third is a half step smaller than a minor third).</p>

<h2 id="inversion">Inversion</h2>
<p>A simple interval can be inverted by raising the lower note an octave, or by lowering the higher note an octave. For example, a minor sixth inverts to a major third.</p>
<p>The following patterns apply to all such inversions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of half steps in an interval and its inversion sum to twelve. E.g. A third and a sixth: 8 + 4 = 12.</li>
<li>The numeric values of an interval and its inversion sum to nine. E.g. A third and a sixth: 3 + 6 = 9.</li>
<li>A major interval always inverts to a minor interval, and vice versa.</li>
<li>A perfect interval always inverts to another perfect interval. E.g. The inversion of a perfect fifth is a perfect fourth, and vice versa.</li>
<li>An augmented interval always inverts to a diminished interval, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
