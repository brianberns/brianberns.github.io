# Music theory: Major and minor scales

*July 2021*

<script>var d = 587.3295;</script>

In a diatonic scale, we have seven notes per octave, in which the half steps (`h`) are separated from each other by alternating groups of two and three whole steps (`W`): `W W W h W W h W W W h W W h` ...

Where we start in this pattern determines whether the scale is considered "major" or "minor":

* Major: `W W h W W W h`
* Minor: `W h W W h W W`

Major scales are often [considered](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/9wf9me/why_are_minor_keys_sad_and_major_keys_happy/) "happy" and minor scales "sad".
