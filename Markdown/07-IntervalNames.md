# Music theory: Interval names

*July 2021*

We are finally in a position to explain the names of intervals that we've been using.[^1]

## Number

An interval's numerical value comes from the number of diatonic notes spanned by the interval. For example, the interval from C to G is a "fifth" because the diatonic sequence from C to G always contains five notes:

* A&flat; major: C-D&flat;-E&flat;-F-G
* C major: C-D-E-F-G

And so on for other diatonic scales containing C and G.

We can stack intervals but have to be careful about the way addition works. For example, C-E is a third, and E-G is a third, but C-G is a fifth (rather than a sixth).

## Major, minor, and perfect intervals

The most consonant intervals within an octave are said to be "perfect" intervals: unison, fourth, fifth, and octave. Consider the difference between a major and minor scale that both begin on the same note (i.e. "parallel" scales). For example, C major/minor:

| # | C major | C minor |
| - | :-----: | :-----: |
| 1 | C       | C       |
| 2 | D       | D       |
| 3 | E       | E&flat; |
| 4 | F       | F       |
| 5 | G       | G       |
| 6 | A       | A&flat; |
| 7 | B       | B&flat; |

Relative to the tonic, the fourth (C-F) and fifth (C-G) intervals are the same in both scales. The other intervals[^2] have major and minor versions:

* Third
  * Major third: C-E
  * Minor third: C-E&flat;
