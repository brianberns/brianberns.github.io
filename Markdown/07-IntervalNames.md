# Music theory: Interval names

*July 2021*

We are finally in a position to explain the names of intervals that we've been using. (This gets complicated quickly, so the explanation will be somewhat simplified.)

## Number

An interval's numerical value comes from the number of diatonic notes spanned by the interval. For example, the interval from C to G is a "fifth" because the diatonic sequence from C to G always contains five notes:

* A&flat; major: C-D&flat;-E&flat;-F-G
* C major: C-D-E-F-G

And so on for other diatonic scales containing C and G.

We can stack intervals but have to be careful about the way addition works. For example, C-E is a third, and E-G is a third, but C-G is a fifth (rather than a sixth).

## Major, minor, and perfect intervals

The most consonant intervals within an octave are said to be "perfect" intervals: unison, fourth, fifth, and octave. Consider the difference between a major and minor scale that both begin on the same note (i.e. "parallel" scales). For example, C major/minor:

| # | C major | C minor |
| - | :-----: | :-----: |
| 1 | C       | C       |
| 2 | D       | D       |
| 3 | E       | E&flat; |
| 4 | F       | F       |
| 5 | G       | G       |
| 6 | A       | A&flat; |
| 7 | B       | B&flat; |

Relative to the tonic, the fourth (C-F) and fifth (C-G) intervals are the same in both scales (as are the unison and octave, of course). The other intervals have major and minor versions:

* Second
  * Major second: C-D
  * Minor second[^1]: C-C&sharp;
* Third
  * Major third: C-E
  * Minor third: C-E&flat;
* Sixth
  * Major sixth: C-A
  * Minor sixth: C-A&flat;
* Seventh
  * Major seventh: C-B
  * Minor seventh: C-B&flat;

The minor version of an interval is always a half step smaller than the major version.

Interval names extend beyond an octave as well. These are called "compound" intervals. For example, a ninth is an octave plus a second, and a (perfect) eleventh is an octave plus a fourth.

## Augmented and diminished intervals

Any interval can be augmented by a half step, or diminished by a half step. An augmented perfect or major interval is called an augmented interval (e.g. an augmented fourth is a half step larger than a perfect fourth). A diminished perfect or minor interval is called a diminished interval (e.g. a diminished third is a half step smaller than a minor third).
