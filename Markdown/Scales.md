# Music theory: Scales

*June 2021*

To define a scale, we would like to pick a set of notes within an octave so that the intervals between the notes are consonant.

## Pythagorean scale

<script>var d = 293.6648;</script>

We can generate such scales using perfect fifths, after Pythagoras. Pick an arbitrary frequency as a starting point (the "tonic"), and then go up in pitch repeatedly by fifths. The first few notes in the series have the following frequency ratios relative to the tonic:

| \# of fifths | Frequency ratio |
| -: | ---------- |
|  0 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>0</sup> = 1
|  1 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>1</sup> = 3&frasl;2
|  2 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>2</sup> = 9&frasl;4
|    | <button title="Play notes" onclick="playRatios([1, 3/2, 9/4], d)">Play &#9654;</button> |

But, wait, 9&frasl;4 is greater than 2, so we need to "normalize" this note so it falls within our target range by moving its pitch down an octave to 9&frasl;8.

We can also find notes in the other direction, moving down by fifths instead of up. Again, we need to normalize these notes so that they are between 1 and 2 &ndash; moving them up by octaves instead of down. The first seven notes generated by this process are:

| Name | \# of fifths | Unnormalized ratio | Normalized ratio |
| - | -: | ---------- | ---------- |
| F | -3 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>-3</sup> = 8&frasl;27 | 32&frasl;27 |
| C | -2 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>-2</sup> = 4&frasl;9  | 16&frasl;9  |
| G | -1 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>-1</sup> = 2&frasl;3  | 4&frasl;3   |
| D |  0 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>0</sup> = 1           | 1           |
| A |  1 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>1</sup> = 3&frasl;2   | 3&frasl;2   |
| E |  2 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>2</sup> = 9&frasl;4   | 9&frasl;8   |
| B |  3 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>3</sup> = 27&frasl;8  | 27&frasl;16 |
|   |    | <button title="Play notes" onclick="playRatios([8/27, 4/9, 2/3, 1, 3/2, 9/4, 27/8], d)">Play &#9654;</button> | <button title="Play notes" onclick="playRatios([32/27, 16/9, 4/3, 1, 3/2, 9/8, 27/16], d)">Play  &#9654;</button> |

We've also given the notes arbitrary names. Let's put these normalized notes in order from lowest to highest within the octave:

| Name | Ratio to tonic | Ratio to previous note |
| - | ----------- | - |
| D | 1 = 1.00 | &ndash; |
| E | 9&frasl;8 = 1.13 | 9&frasl;8 : 1 = 9&frasl;8 |
| F | 32&frasl;27 = 1.19 | 32&frasl;27 : 9&frasl;8 = 256&frasl;243 |
| G | 4&frasl;3 = 1.33 | 4&frasl;3 : 32&frasl;27 = 9&frasl;8 |
| A | 3&frasl;2 = 1.50 | 3&frasl;2 : 4&frasl;3 = 9&frasl;8 |
| B | 27&frasl;16 = 1.69 | 27&frasl;16 : 3&frasl;2 = 9&frasl;8 |
| C | 16&frasl;9 = 1.78 | 16&frasl;9 : 27&frasl;16 = 256&frasl;243 |
| D | 2&frasl;1 = 2.00 | 2&frasl;1 : 16&frasl;9 = 9&frasl;8 |
|   | <button title="Play notes" onclick="playRatios([1, 9/8, 32/27, 4/3, 3/2, 27/16, 16/9, 2], d)">Play &#9654;</button> |

So the notes in this scale are D, E, F, G, A, B, and C. The scale then lands back on D, one octave higher.

## Diatonic scales

We've also computed the ratio of each note relative to the previous note in the scale. Luckily[^1], there are only two distinct step sizes in the scale:

| Step size | Name |
| - | - |
| 9&frasl;8 = 1.13 | Whole step |
| 256&frasl;243 = 1.05 | Half step |

As a result, the notes in the scale are distributed somewhat evenly throughout the octave, which seems desirable. The pattern of whole (`W`) and half (`h`) steps is `W h W W W h W`, but since the scale repeats at every octave, so does the pattern: `W h W W W h W W h W W W h W W h W W W h W` ... . Any scale that follows a similar pattern of half steps separated by two or three whole steps is called a [diatonic scale](https://www.phys.uconn.edu/~gibson/Notes/Section3_4/Sec3_4.htm), such as the white keys on a piano.

[^1]: Is it luck? There doesn't seem to be anything in the process that guarantees such an outcome mathematically, but I could be wrong. It just seems to work out nicely.
