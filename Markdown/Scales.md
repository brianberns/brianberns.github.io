# Scales

*June 2021*

To define a scale, we would like to pick a set of notes within an octave so that the intervals between the notes are consonant.

## Pythagorean scale

One way to accomplish this is based on perfect fifths. We can pick an arbitrary frequency as a starting point (the "tonic"), and then go up in pitch repeatedly by fifths. The first few notes of the scale have the following frequency ratios relative to the tonic:

| \# of fifths from tonic | Frequency ratio |
| -: | ---------- |
|  0 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>0</sup> = 1
|  1 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>1</sup> = 3&frasl;2
|  2 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>2</sup> = 9&frasl;4

But, wait, 9&frasl;4 is greater than 2, so we need to "normalize" this note so it falls within our target range by moving its pitch down an octave to 9&frasl;8.

We can also find notes in the other direction, moving down by fifths instead of up. Again, we need to normalize these notes so that they are between 1 and 2 &ndash; moving them up one or more octaves instead of down. The first five notes generated by this process are:

| \# of fifths from tonic | Unnormalized ratio | Normalized ratio (between 1 and 2) |
| -: | ---------- | ---------- |
| -2 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>-2</sup> = 4&frasl;9 | 16&frasl;9 |
| -1 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>-1</sup> = 2&frasl;3 | 4&frasl;3  |
|  0 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>0</sup> = 1          | 1          |
|  1 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>1</sup> = 3&frasl;2  | 3&frasl;2  |
|  2 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>2</sup> = 9&frasl;4  | 9&frasl;8  |
