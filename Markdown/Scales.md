# Scales

*June 2021*

To define a scale, we would like to pick a set of notes within an octave so that the intervals between the notes are consonant.

## Pythagorean scale

We can generate such scales using perfect fifths, after Pythagoras. Pick an arbitrary frequency as a starting point (the "tonic"), and then go up in pitch repeatedly by fifths. The first few notes in the series have the following frequency ratios relative to the tonic:

| \# of fifths | Frequency ratio |
| -: | ---------- |
|  0 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>0</sup> = 1
|  1 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>1</sup> = 3&frasl;2
|  2 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>2</sup> = 9&frasl;4

But, wait, 9&frasl;4 is greater than 2, so we need to "normalize" this note so it falls within our target range by moving its pitch down an octave to 9&frasl;8.

We can also find notes in the other direction, moving down by fifths instead of up. Again, we need to normalize these notes so that they are between 1 and 2 &ndash; moving them up one or more octaves instead of down. The first five notes generated by this process are:

| Name | \# of fifths | Unnormalized ratio | Normalized ratio |
| - | -: | ---------- | ---------- |
| C | -2 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>-2</sup> = 4&frasl;9  | 16&frasl;9  |
| G | -1 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>-1</sup> = 2&frasl;3  | 4&frasl;3   |
| D |  0 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>0</sup> = 1           | 1           |
| A |  1 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>1</sup> = 3&frasl;2   | 3&frasl;2   |
| E |  2 | (3&frasl;2)<sup>2</sup> = 9&frasl;4   | 9&frasl;8   |

We've also given the notes names (which seem arbitrary, but will be explained later). Let's put these normalized notes in order from lowest to highest within the octave:

| Name | Normalized ratio |
| - | ----------- |
| D | 1 = 1.00 |
| E | 9&frasl;8 = 1.13 |
| G | 4&frasl;3 = 1.33 |
| A | 3&frasl;2 = 1.50 |
| C | 16&frasl;9 = 1.78 |

This series of notes (D, E, G, A, and C) in an octave is called the [pentatonic scale](https://www.phys.uconn.edu/~gibson/Notes/Section3_4/Sec3_4.htm) (where "pentatonic" just means a scale containing five notes).
